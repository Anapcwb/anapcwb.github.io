    <h1>Hi, I'm Ana!</h1>

    <p>After ten years living in Japan, I returned to Brazil and joined the University, majoring in Information Management. During my studies, I had the opportunity to learn the basics of programming and I could realise the importance of keeping myself up-to-date with the fast moving world we live in.</p>

    <p>I'm excited to have new experiences and to dive deep into programming. I see Founders and Coders as a great opportunity to change the direction of my career, to develop new skills and to be more involved in the London Tech community. </p>

    <p>Coding, broadening my horizons and cultivate a healthy community are my drivers and it's what keep myself motivated to always improve.</p>
